Red Eyes Yellow Crown – Horror Game (Version 0.3 - In Development)

Red Eyes Yellow Crown is a psychological horror game about addiction and its terrifying consequences. The protagonist struggles with an overwhelming dependence on the mysterious energy drink Red Eyes Yellow Crown. As the addiction deepens, reality distorts, paranoia grows, and nightmarish visions begin to haunt them.

Set in a retro 2D pixel-art world, the game explores the dark psychological effects of addiction. Players will experience surreal hallucinations, disturbing encounters, and an eerie atmosphere that keeps them questioning what is real and what is a side effect of the drink.

This early version (0.3) is still in development, with ongoing improvements to mechanics, storytelling, and horror elements. Future updates will expand the protagonist’s journey, introduce new gameplay features, and deepen the psychological horror experience.

Can you escape the grip of addiction, or will the drink consume you completely?
